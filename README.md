# Qunnect4

---

Qunnect4 is designed as an educational board game rooted in the principles of quantum mechanics. With using simulated bichromatic photons, it illustrates the counterintuitive aspects of quantum phenomena and explains fundamental concepts such as superposition, collapse, and entanglement. By encapsulating quantum physics within a physical board game format, Qunnect4 bridges the mysterious realm of quantum physics with the classical world, providing a straightforward, interactive and hands-on experience.

## Construction of Apparatus

Qunnect4 consists of 42 tokens and 1 game board.

Each token is made with a PCB, assembled with one blue and one red LED, two resistors, four diodes, one radio transmitter and one receiver, four push buttons, and one battery holder. Powered by a battery, a token simulates a bichromatic photon. The token is superposed when turned on initially, emitting both blue and red LEDs. When a red or blue button is pushed, the token collapses, emitting only one LED.

The 42 tokens are grouped into 21 pairs. Each pair of tokens simulate a pair of “entangled photons”, with using the paired radio modules. Measuring one token will collapse both tokens simultaneously (one red and one blue).

The game board can be made with wood or foam board.

## Use of Apparatus

As a quantum adaptation of the popular game Connect 4, Qunnect4 is designed to provide hands-on experiences that help players quickly learn key quantum concepts such as superposition, collapse, and entanglement with ease.

Players are encouraged to use the apparatus in a manner like playing Connect 4, with following differences:

- In classic Connect 4, each player places 1 token each turn.
- In Qunnect 4, each player places a pair of entangled tokens each turn.
- A player may choose not to place tokens. Instead, the player can press a button to
collapse a pair of entangled tokens on board.
- To prevent a cycling condition, where one player always collapses the tokens placed by
the other, a player is not allowed to collapse a token unless its row or column is fully occupied This rule ensures a fair and balanced gameplay experience for both players.
