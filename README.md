# Qunnect4 Web

---

Qunnect4 Web is designed as an online educational board game rooted in the principles of quantum mechanics. With using simulated bichromatic photons, it illustrates the counterintuitive aspects of quantum phenomena and explains fundamental concepts such as superposition, collapse, and entanglement. By encapsulating quantum physics within a board game format, Qunnect4 Web bridges the mysterious realm of quantum physics with the classical world, providing a straightforward and interactive experience.

Derived from its original physical version, Qunnect4 Web has been developed as a web application, ensuring cost-free accessibility and improved availability.
